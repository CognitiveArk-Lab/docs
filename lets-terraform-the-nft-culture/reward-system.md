# ðŸŽ¯ Reward System

Our goal is to build a sustainable community that encourages the NFT holder to play the game to earn more rewards. There are three primary rewards from our gamification:

1. [Staking Reward](reward-system.md#1.-staking-reward)
2. [Biweekly Reward:](reward-system.md#2.-biweekly-reward)
   * Legendary NFT.
   * $UST.
3. &#x20;[Comic Page Airdrops.](reward-system.md#3.-comic-page-airdrops)

### <mark style="color:yellow;">1. Staking Reward</mark>

We will allocate [royalties](../i-want-to-know-more/funds-allocation.md#royalty) from the secondary sales staking rewards. NFT holders that stake their NFT will receive passive income paid in $LUNA.
