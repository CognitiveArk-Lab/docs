# üéØ Reward System

Our goal is to build a sustainable community that encourages the Memory holder to play the game to earn more rewards. There are three primary rewards from our gamification:

1. [Biweekly Reward:](reward-system.md#2.-biweekly-reward)
   * Legendary Memory.
   * $UST.
2. [Comic Chapter Airdrops.](reward-system.md#3.-comic-page-airdrops)
3. [Staking Reward](reward-system.md#1.-staking-reward)

Memory holders who completed the Timeline and ended up in the Top 10 Bi-weekly Leaderboards will receive a portion from the Reward Pool.&#x20;
