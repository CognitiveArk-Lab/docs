# üéØ Reward System

Our goal is to build a sustainable community that encourages the Memory holder to play the game to earn more rewards. There are three primary rewards from our gamification:

## <mark style="color:yellow;">1. Reward Pool</mark>

Memory holders who completed the Timeline and ended up in the Top 10 Bi-weekly Leaderboards will receive a portion from the Reward Pool.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
_2.5% out of the minting proceeds will go to Reward Pool, thus ensuring a reward to be distributed for the first month of launching. More about it_ [_here_](../i-want-to-know-more/funds-allocation.md#initial-sale)_._
{% endhint %}

### Timeline winners allocation:

* ü•á Top 1: 20%
* ü•à Top 2-3: 15%
* ü•â Top 4-5: 10%
* üèÖ Top 6-10: 6%

{% hint style="warning" %}
The amount of the rewards for each cycle can be higher depending on the influx from the source funds.
{% endhint %}

### Reward Pool source of funds:

* 25% from secondary sales [Royalties](../i-want-to-know-more/funds-allocation.md#royalty)
* 20% from [Colony Investment Program (CIP)](../i-want-to-know-more/funds-allocation.md#colony-investment-program-cip)

## <mark style="color:yellow;">2. Timeline Reward</mark>

Every two weeks, we will conclude the Timeline cycle and announce the winner to receive:

*   #### &#x20;<mark style="color:purple;">Legendary Memory</mark>

    The Top 1 player in the Leaderboard will receive _1 Legendary Memory_ that holds many benefits and can be played in our gamification V2 update.
*   <mark style="color:purple;">**Comic Chapter Airdrops**</mark>

    Each player participating in The Timeline will receive a copy of the comic chapter with the winner Memory printed as the main character.

## <mark style="color:yellow;">3. Colony Lottery Pool</mark>

### Colony Lottery source of funds:

* 10% from secondary sales [Royalties](../i-want-to-know-more/funds-allocation.md#royalty)
* 10% from [Colony Investment Program (CIP)](../i-want-to-know-more/funds-allocation.md#colony-investment-program-cip)

{% hint style="warning" %}
We will set the initial amount of the rewards for each Lottery to a **maximum** **$1,000.00**. If more than $1,000.00 is in the Pool, the funds will carry on to the next raffle.
