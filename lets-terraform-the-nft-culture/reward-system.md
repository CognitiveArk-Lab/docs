# ðŸŽ¯ Reward System

Our goal is to build a sustainable community that encourages the NFT holder to play the game to earn more rewards. There are three primary rewards from our gamification:

1. [Staking Reward](reward-system.md#1.-staking-reward)
2. [Biweekly Reward:](reward-system.md#2.-biweekly-reward)
   * Legendary NFT.
   * $UST.
3. &#x20;[Comic Page Airdrops.](reward-system.md#3.-comic-page-airdrops)

### <mark style="color:yellow;">1. Staking Reward</mark>

We will allocate royalties from the 2nd marketplace (_Luart 3,15%_ and _RandomEarth 4,5%_) for staking rewards. NFT holders that stake their NFT will receive passive income paid in $LUNA.

    Number 1 player in the biweekly Leaderboard will receive 1 Legendary NFT that can be played in our gamification v2 update.

    We will airdrop $UST to the top 100 players in the biweekly Leaderboard.
