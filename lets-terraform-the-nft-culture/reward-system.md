# ðŸŽ¯ Reward System

Our goal is to build a sustainable community that encourages the Memory holder to play the game to earn more rewards. There are three primary rewards from our gamification:

1. [Biweekly Reward:](reward-system.md#2.-biweekly-reward)
   * Legendary Memory.
   * $UST.
2. [Comic Chapter Airdrops.](reward-system.md#3.-comic-page-airdrops)
3. [Staking Reward](reward-system.md#1.-staking-reward)

### <mark style="color:yellow;">1. Biweekly Reward</mark>

Every two weeks, we will announce the winner to receive:

*   #### &#x20;<mark style="color:purple;">Legendary Memory</mark>

    The top 1 player in the biweekly Leaderboard will receive 1 Legendary Memory that holds many benefits and can be played in our gamification V2 update.
*   <mark style="color:purple;">**$UST**</mark>

    We will airdrop $UST to the top 100 players in the biweekly Leaderboard.

Each player participating in The ARK(LINK TO GAMIFICATION) will receive a copy of the comic chapter with the winner Memory printed as the main character.

We will allocate [royalties](../i-want-to-know-more/funds-allocation.md#royalty) from the secondary sales staking rewards. Players that stake their Memory will receive passive income paid in $LUNA.
