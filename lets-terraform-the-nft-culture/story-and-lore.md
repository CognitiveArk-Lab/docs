&#x20;**Synopsis:**

"Throughout the years, mankind has faced countless losses and blessings - great wars and times of peace. But, although destruction and resurrection are ever inevitable, mankind cannot escape from their biggest enemy: their own _ego_.\


For some, immortality was the key to mankind's biggest mystery - their own existence. Once mankind discovered that death was inevitable, death __ itself became humanity's common enemy. For this reason, mankind finally put aside their differences and moved towards the same goal. Throughout the passage of time, along with the flourishing of new technology, mankind found a way to prolong their existence. _The Cognitive Ark_ was born.\


_The Cognitive Ark_ was a device capable of transferring human consciousness into another object at will. The machine scattered the very foundation of a soul: the conscious memories. The process involved a hazardous neuro-psychological method that required a strong body, mind, and spirit to withstand it. It could even take one's life or scramble one's mind to the point of no return. Nevertheless, it granted access to the One Consciousness - _"_The All'.\


In the Ark, those who survived the procedure would be granted a greater and higher knowledge of existence, downloading numerous probabilities that reality could offer. Many had tried, and many had failed. Yet, the survivors were given the fruit of immortality, able to preserve their consciousness through transference at will.\


One of the founders of the Ark committed an act of treason that humanity had prohibited, which snowballed into a great calamity that slowly consumed all living beings on Earth. This immense tragedy, later known as _**The Rapture Effect**,_ forced humanity to leave Earth.\
