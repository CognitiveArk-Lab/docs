&#x20;**Background Story:**

"Throughout the years, mankind has faced countless losses and blessings - great wars and times of peace. But, although destruction and resurrection are ever inevitable, mankind cannot escape from their biggest enemy: their own _ego_.\


For some, immortality was the key to mankind's biggest mystery - their own existence. Once mankind discovered that death was inevitable, death __ itself became humanity's common enemy. For this reason, mankind finally put aside their differences and moved towards the same goal. Throughout the passage of time, along with the flourishing of new technology, mankind found a way to prolong their existence. _The Cognitive Ark_ was born.\

_The Cognitive Ark_ was a device capable of transferring human consciousness into another object at will. The machine scattered the very foundation of a soul: the conscious memories. The process involved a hazardous neuro-psychological method that required a strong body, mind, and spirit to withstand it. It could even take one's life or scramble one's mind to the point of no return. Nevertheless, it granted access to the One Consciousness - _"_The All'.\


In the Ark, those who survived the procedure would be granted a greater and higher knowledge of existence, downloading numerous probabilities that reality could offer. Many had tried, and many had failed. Yet, the survivors were given the fruit of immortality, able to preserve their consciousness through transference at will.\

In the 23nd century, the Earth is no longer a habitable place for a living being due to a virus outbreak that mass genocide most of the earthlings (Humans and non-humans alike).\
As the Earth started to lose its life force and resources, the remaining human beings were forced to leave the planet to search for another world to continue to exist. Thus, the mothership "Messiah" was created, and humans ventured into endless space with the "Messiah".\
