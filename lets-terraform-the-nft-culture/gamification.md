# ðŸŽ® Gamification

## Introduction

We are reshaping the NFT landscape through our new gamification. Many NFT projects have evolved and adopted the play-to-earn (P2E) system. Who doesn't want to earn while playing games, right? It quickly became a BUZZWORD to create exposure for the projects, but unfortunately, most of them failed as it is not sustainable for the long term. The concept of making a P2E game is revolutionary. However, we need the proper execution to make the game sustainable. CognitiveArk is developed to become a part of this revolutionary movement.

To understand what we aim to do, we need to step back and analyze the gaming industry that we are familiar with. Most centralized MMORPG games have their economy thrive because they do not allow the players to cash out or sell the in-game currency directly to other players. To put it in another way, they do not own the assets. Decentralized games aim to change this fundamental issue. They want to give the ownership back to the player's hands. But this comes with a high cost  too, as most people in this space come from the DeFi scene. The people are primarily investors who fundamentally pursue the profit and not the actual players who love, appreciate, and enjoy the game. Early investors have advantages over the player who joined at a later stage as the early adopters will use the newer player as their exit liquidity. This cycle persists until the project cannot sustain the selling pressure and burns the project to the ground. To alter this behavior, we incentivize players to play the game instead of staking their NFT to earn ERC20 tokens.

#### Instead of a simple Airdrop reward to a random NFT holder, we encourage the players/investors to play the game to get rewarded!

Every player has the same opportunity to win the rewards, the time you join our community doesn't dictate the odds of winning, and there is **ZERO** risk to be dumped on by early investors! This will sustain our project and create an authentic community that plays around the concepts and values the work we put into it!
