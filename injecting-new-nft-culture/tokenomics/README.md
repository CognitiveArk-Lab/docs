## Initial Token Distribution

The initial mint of $ARK token is 20% of the total maximum supply, and will be distributed as follows:

{% hint style="info" %}
_From the total initial mint of 20%, **only 2,5%** will circulate upon launching._
{% endhint %}

### 1. Initial Liquidity Pool - 2% (140,000 $ARK)

* 140,000 $ARK will be paired with $10,000 worth of $SOL (with a weighted pool of 80/20)

### 2. Strategic Partnership - 8% (560,000 $ARK)

* 560,000 $ARK tokens are reserved for upcoming partnerships and incentivize future partners to grow and thrive together with TCA ecosystem.

### 3. Vested Team Funds - 10% (700,000 $ARK)

* We are here to develop further and push NFT boundaries, meaning we commit ourselves to build with our community.&#x20;
* 5% initial allowance (35,000 $ARK) and 95% (665,000 $ARK) will be vested linearly over two years. This will incentivize the team to continue innovating, building, and expanding more use cases for the $ARK token.

## Token Emissions

{% hint style="success" %}
_After the initial mint of 20%, the remaining total supply will be emitted over two years (see Emission Schedule)._
{% endhint %}

### Memory Staking Reward - 70% (4,900,000 $ARK)

* Distributed directly to _**Memory stakers**_

### Treasury Funds - 10% (700,000 $ARK)

* ArkDAO will have the opportunity to decide where to spend the Treasury Funds
* TCA Team will not ever use nor take advantage of Treasury Funds
* After we are well established, the Treasury Funds will be secured by 3/4 multisig wallet, consisting of 1 TCA Team member and 3 well-known community members

## Swap Fees

TCA will provide Liquidity Pool for $ARK-$SOL, and TCA **does not charge any protocol fee** for this Pool; however, there will be a **0,30% swap fee** to incentive the Liquidity Provider. Anyone who has $ARK or $SOL can ZAP in to participate in the $ARK-$SOL liquidity pool. The swap fee will be denominated in the input token.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
_**Example:** Joe is swapping 1 $SOL for 10 $ARK; Joe will then have to pay the fee in $SOL which is 0,003 $SOL._
{% endhint %}

#### The swap fees will then be redistributed as follows:

* Liquidity Provider 80%
* Pool expansion 20%

{% hint style="success" %}
_TCA initial liquidity pool swap fees will be **100% redistributed for $ARK stakers**._
{% endhint %}
