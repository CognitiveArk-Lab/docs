"_`Among the survivors who inhabited the Mothership Messiah, some machine-like figures could be found roaming around over the years. They possessed humanlike faces, expressing emotions just like humans, and even speaking like one. Some would say that they're almost exactly like humans in cyber bodies. They don't appear hostile; instead, they seem to aid in the development of the colony. To this day, their origins remain a mystery.`_"
