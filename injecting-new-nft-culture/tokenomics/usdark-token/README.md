## <mark style="color:yellow;">Swap Fees</mark>

TCA will provide Liquidity Pool for $ARK-$SOL, and TCA **does not charge any protocol fee** for this Pool; however, there will be a **0,30% swap fee** to incentive the Liquidity Provider. Anyone who has $ARK or $SOL can ZAP in to participate in the $ARK-$SOL liquidity pool. The swap fee will be denominated in the input token.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
_**Example:** Joe is swapping 1 $SOL for 10 $ARK; Joe will then have to pay the fee in $SOL which is 0,003 $SOL._
{% endhint %}

#### The swap fees will then be redistributed as follows:

* Liquidity Provider 80%
* Pool expansion 20%

{% hint style="success" %}
