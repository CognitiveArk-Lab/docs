$ARK is TCA native governance token and anyone can stake $ARK as a single asset or stake the $ARK-$SOL LP token in [TCA Vault](./#tca-vaults) to exercise the rights to vote/create proposals for [Treasury Funds](../../../i-want-to-know-more/funds-allocation.md#treasury). Every stakers will also receive a portion of the protocol multichain investment program.

{% hint style="warning" %}
_TCA Vault will be open after 1 month of conducting the colony_ [_Multichain Investment Program_](../../../i-want-to-know-more/funds-allocation.md#multichain-investment-program-mip)_. This will provide enough yield distribution for TCA Vault stakers._
{% endhint %}

## <mark style="color:yellow;">Initial Token Distribution</mark>

#### The initial mint of $ARK token is 20% of the total maximum supply, and will be distributed as follows:

### 1. Initial Liquidity Pool - 2% (140,000 $ARK)

* 140,000 $ARK will be paired with $10,000 worth of $SOL (with a weighted pool of 80/20)

## <mark style="color:yellow;">TCA Vaults</mark>

In the beginning, we will launch 2 Vaults:

1. Single staking $ARK
2. $ARK-$SOL LP token staking

TCA Vault is a smart contract that holds generated yields from the colony MIP, Minigames taxes and Royalty. Distributing them among the $ARK stakers. Furthermore, LP token stakers are entitled to earn an additional yield from the [Swap Fee](./#swap-fees) earned in TCA ecosystem.

## <mark style="color:yellow;">Swap Fees</mark>

TCA will initially provide a Liquidity Pool for $ARK-$SOL. TCA **does not charge any protocol fee** for this Pool; however, there will be a **0,30% swap fee** to incentive the Liquidity Provider. Anyone who has $ARK or $SOL can participate in the $ARK-$SOL liquidity pool.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
_The swap fee will be denominated in the input token._&#x20;

_**Example:** Joe is swapping 1 $SOL for 100 $ARK; Joe will then have to pay the fee in $SOL which is 0,003 $SOL._
{% endhint %}

#### The swap fees will then be redistributed as follows:

* Liquidity Provider 80%
* Pool expansion 20%

{% hint style="success" %}
_TCA initial liquidity pool swap fees will be **100% redistributed for $ARK stakers**._
{% endhint %}
