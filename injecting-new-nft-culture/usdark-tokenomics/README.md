## <mark style="color:yellow;">ARK-Chamber</mark>

ARK-Chamber is a place for $ARK holders to spend or stake their $ARK to earn a share of TCA project revenue from _**Ark Vault**_.

Spend your $ARK for:

* Buy raffle tickets to have a chance of getting NFTs / $SOL
* Buy whitelist tickets for partner projects
* Exclusive upcoming TCA NFT releases
* and many more to come

In the beginning, there will be 2 types of staking in ARK-Chamber:

1. Single staking $ARK
2. $ARK-$USDC LP-token staking

**TCA Vault** is a smart contract that holds generated yields from the colony [_MIP (Multichain Investment Program)_](../../i-want-to-know-more/funds-allocation.md#multichain-investment-program-mip), Minigames taxes, and [_Royalty_](../../i-want-to-know-more/funds-allocation.md#royalty)â€”distributing them among the $ARK stakers. Furthermore, LP token stakers are entitled to earn an additional yield from the __ [_Swap Fee_](./#swap-fees) gained in TCA ecosystem.

## <mark style="color:yellow;">Swap Fees</mark>

TCA will initially provide a Liquidity Pool for $ARK-$USDC. TCA **does not charge any protocol fee** for this Pool; however, there will be a **0,30% swap fee** to incentive the Liquidity Provider. Anyone who has $ARK or $USDC can participate in the $ARK-$USDC liquidity pool.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
_The swap fee will be denominated in the input token._&#x20;

_**Example:** Joe is swapping 100 $USDC for 1000 $ARK; Joe will then have to pay the fee in $USDC which is 0,300 $USDC._
{% endhint %}

#### The swap fees will then be redistributed as follows:

* 80% back to Liquidity Provider
* 20% for Pool expansion
