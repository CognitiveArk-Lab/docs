# 🎯 Reward System

Our goal is to build a sustainable community that encourages the Memory holder to play the game to earn more rewards. There are three primary rewards from our gamification:

## <mark style="color:yellow;">1. Reward Pool</mark>

Memory holders who completed the Timeline and ended up in the Top 10 Bi-weekly Leaderboards will receive a portion of the Reward Pool.&#x20;

{% hint style="success" %}
_There will be a reward of **$1,000.00** or **more** available for **10 players** who score the most points each cycle._

_The reward will be paid out in form of **$USDC**_
{% endhint %}

### Timeline winners allocation:

* 🏆 Top 1: 15%
* 🥇 Top 2-3: 12,5%
* 🥈 Top 4-5: 10%
* 🥉 Top 6-10: 8%

{% hint style="info" %}
_The reward is subject to change depending on source funds, more on this on_ [_Funds Allocation_](../i-want-to-know-more/funds-allocation.md) _>_ [_Reward Pool_](../i-want-to-know-more/funds-allocation.md#reward-pool)__
{% endhint %}

## <mark style="color:yellow;">2. Timeline Reward</mark>

Every two weeks, we will conclude the Timeline cycle and announce the winner to receive:

*   #### &#x20;<mark style="color:purple;">Legendary Memory</mark>

    The Top 1 player in the Leaderboard will receive _**1 Legendary Memory**_ that can be played on our _Legendary Timeline_, and holds many benefits and can be played in our gamification V2 update.
*   <mark style="color:purple;">**Comic Chapter Airdrops**</mark>

    Each player participating in The Timeline will receive a copy of the comic chapter with the winner Memory printed as the main character.

## <mark style="color:yellow;">3. Colony Lottery Pool</mark>

### Colony Lottery source of funds:

* 20% from secondary sales [Royalties](../i-want-to-know-more/funds-allocation.md#royalty)
* 10% from [Colony Investment Program (CIP)](../i-want-to-know-more/funds-allocation.md#colony-investment-program-cip)

{% hint style="warning" %}
_We will set the initial amount of the rewards for each Lottery to a **maximum**  **$1,000.00**. If more than $1,000.00 is in the Pool, the funds will carry on to the next raffle._
