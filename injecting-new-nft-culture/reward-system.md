# 🎯 Reward System

Our goal is to build a sustainable community that encourages the Memory holder to play the game to earn more rewards. There are three primary rewards from our gamification:

## <mark style="color:yellow;">1. Reward Pool</mark>

Memory holders who completed the Timeline and ended up in the Top 10 Bi-weekly Leaderboards will receive a portion of the Reward Pool.&#x20;

{% hint style="success" %}
_There will be a reward of **$1,000.00** or **more** available for **10 players** who score the most points each cycle._

_The reward will be paid out in form of **$USDC**_
{% endhint %}

### Timeline winners allocation:

* 🏆 Top 1: 15%
* 🥇 Top 2-3: 12,5%
* 🥈 Top 4-5: 10%
* 🥉 Top 6-10: 8%

{% hint style="info" %}
_The reward is subject to change depending on source funds, more on this on_ [_Funds Allocation_](../i-want-to-know-more/funds-allocation.md) _>_ [_Reward Pool_](../i-want-to-know-more/funds-allocation.md#reward-pool)__
{% endhint %}

## <mark style="color:yellow;">2. Timeline Reward</mark>

In addition to <mark style="color:yellow;">Reward Pool</mark>, we will conclude the Timeline cycle and announce the winner to receive:

*   #### &#x20;<mark style="color:purple;">Legendary Memory (NFT)</mark>

    Only <mark style="color:yellow;">**Top 1**</mark>**  **<mark style="color:yellow;">**player**</mark> in the Leaderboard will receive _<mark style="color:purple;">**1**</mark>**  **<mark style="color:purple;">**Legendary Memory**</mark>_ that can be played on our last chapter the _**Legendary Timeline**_.
*   <mark style="color:purple;">**Comic Chapter Airdrops (NFT)**</mark>

    Each player participating in The Timeline will receive a copy of the comic chapter with the winner Memory printed as the main character.

## <mark style="color:yellow;">3. Staking Reward</mark>

There are two types of staking:

*   <mark style="color:purple;">**NFT Staking**</mark>

    Earn $ARK for staking your Memory on the Timeline.
*   <mark style="color:purple;">**$ARK Staking**</mark>

    Earn a share of __ [_TCA Vault_](tokenomics/usdark-token/#tca-vaults) by staking $ARK as a single side asset or by staking LP-token on [ARK-Chamber](tokenomics/usdark-token/#ark-chamber).

{% hint style="danger" %}
_Staking Memory is the only way to mint $ARK from TCA ecosystem._
{% endhint %}
