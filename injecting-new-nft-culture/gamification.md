# üéÆ Gamification

## <mark style="color:yellow;">Introduction</mark> üëã

To understand what we aim to do, we need to step back and analyze the gaming industry that we are familiar with. Most centralized MMORPG games have their economy thrive because they do not allow the players to cash out or sell the in-game currency directly to other players. To put it in another way, they do not own the assets.&#x20;

Decentralized games aim to change this fundamental issue. They want to give the ownership back to the player's hands. But this comes with a high cost too, as most people in this space come from the DeFi scene. The people are primarily investors who fundamentally pursue the profit and not the actual players who love, appreciate, and enjoy the game. Early investors have advantages over the player who joined at a later stage as the early adopters will use the newer player as their exit liquidity. This cycle persists until the project cannot sustain the selling pressure and burns the project to the ground.&#x20;

Here in **The Cognitive Ark**, every player has the same opportunity to win the rewards, the time you join our community doesn't dictate the odds of winning!

## <mark style="color:yellow;">Getting Started üß≠</mark>

The gamification system will be designed based on the stories and lore of the Cognitive Ark. The memory holder has to interpret the current Timeline and reveal the plot so the story can progress.

### The Memory

CognitiveArk gen0 NFT is called **Memory.** As a Memory holder, you will get exclusive rights to play the game. \
There are four rarities based on four types of Memory:

* Unknown Memories (_Common_)
* Memory of The Present (_Rare_)
* Memory of The Past (_Mystic_)
* Memory of The Future (_Epic_)

### The Timeline (Comic Template)

## <mark style="color:yellow;">Game Mechanics ‚öôÔ∏è</mark>

CognitiveArk NFT has a different approach to P2E (Play-to-Earn). We allocate a considerable reward to our Memory holders for really playing and a premium reward on top for scoring the most points. The game mechanics are straightforward:

#### 1. Stake your Memory on the empty panel on the Timeline.&#x20;

![A player stake a  Memory on Timeline#1](<../.gitbook/assets/Gamification - Frame 1 (1).gif>)

{% hint style="info" %}
_Some Panels will have hints on it; if you can fulfill the requirements, you will score more points, and if you stake the accurate rarity, you get $ARK multiplier as long as the panel is still active._
{% endhint %}

#### 2. Choose a narrative bubble and drag it to the correct position. Each correct narrative bubble and each correct bubble position will give the player more points.

#### 3. After you stake your Memory, your Memory will be locked for two days before you can unstake it.

#### 4. To change the narrative bubble or the position, you need to unstake your Memory.

The Team will update the new Timeline on the website by the end of each cycle.

### Timeline Cycle

**One cycle of Timeline will last for two weeks**. Each Timeline will have one or more empty panels. The panels will feature a side quest that gives players bonus points and $ARK multiplier. After the cycles ended, the Lore Master will assess all players' interpretations and give up to 30 points to the closest accurate narration.

{% hint style="success" %}
_Make sure you put your Memory in the right panel to get bonus points and a reward multiplier to amplify your $ARK gain._
{% endhint %}

### Points

The goal is to score the highest points by the end of each cycle. If there are the same points among players, we will prioritize players with longer staking time.

* 10 pts for every correct narrative bubble
* 10 pts for every correct bubble position
* 10 pts for  each special panel
* 1-30 pts from story interpretations

### Leaderboard

The Leaderboard will show the current points and the total points from previous Timeline cycles. The Team will update it four days after the end of each Timeline cycle (2 weeks). Users who score the most points on that Timeline will win the game.
