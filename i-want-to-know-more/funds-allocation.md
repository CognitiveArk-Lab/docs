# üèõ Funds Allocation

## Initial Sale ‚ú®

Distributions from minting sales are as follow:

* 70% to Project Wallet.
  * 80% to Treasury
  * 20% to Operational Funds
* 2.5% to Reward Pool
* 2.5% to Angel Protocol
* 25% to Team.

## Project Wallet üöÄ

Project Wallet will be maintained together by the Colony and Team. It is vital for our future project development like Gamification V2, Merch Store, Marketing, and overall welfare of the Colony. In a Nutshell, the Project Wallet is our thrust engine that keeps our Mega Spaceship (Messiah) exploring the fastness space of Terra-verse.

## Treasury üíµ

The funds in the Treasury will be later managed by the community decision (DAO). At first, we will allocate the funds to the Colony Investment Program.

### Colony Investment Program (CIP) üìà

CIP is a yield farming strategy leveraging the Terra DeFi ecosystem. With the Colony behind the Treasury, we will discover the best yet safest investment on Terra Ecosystem. Use your DeFi knowledge to propose or vote for the best yield farming strategy to expand our Colony economy!

**The first CIP allocation is as follows:**

* **70% into** [**Anchor**](https://app.anchorprotocol.com/earn) **to receive \~19,47 APY in $UST (Locked for 2 Years).**
* **30% into the community chosen projects on Terra.**

{% hint style="info" %}
_30% from Treasury will be invested in Terra Ecosystem projects that are chosen by the Ark-DAO. The Colony will be able to submit a proposal after our initial minting phase is over._
{% endhint %}

After the first CIP allocation, the Ark-DAO will have the capacity to decide how the Colony will spend the Treasury. Some _ideas_ but not limited to:

* Reinvest in Colony Investment Program
* Raising Memory floor price
* Boost the Reward Pool
* Boost the Colony Lottery Pool

## Operational Fundsüíº

![](<../.gitbook/assets/Finance - DOCS ALLOCATION A 3 (1).jpg>)

It is crucial for the Colony to be able to separate Treasury from Project expenses because we have a long road ahead of us.

We will use the Operational Funds mainly on:&#x20;

* Merch Store!
* Marketing
* Development

### Merch Store üõçÔ∏è

What about having our Merch Store that integrates cryptocurrency as the primary payment system? Get your hands on CognitiveArk Tees, Caps, Art prints, and many more!&#x20;

We will funnel the profits back into the Treasury and Project Wallet and increase our existence in both the digital and real world.

### Marketing üì°

We will use the Marketing funds to expand our exposure to other communities. The focus will be on media content like videos, images, and collaborations.

### Development üß∞

We are here to innovate! To be able to terraform the NFT community is our primary goal. We will explore the possibilities of NFT 2.0 to bring more dynamics into our gamification.

## Royalty üßæ

The royalties from the secondary NFT marketplace are distributed directly into the[ Staking Pool](../lets-terraform-the-nft-culture/tokenomics.md#staking-pool-distribution), where the Colony can claim the rewards on our Dashboard on the website.

{% hint style="warning" %}
_Staking rewards will be first distributed after **4 weeks** of the minting phase._
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
Get a higher share from the staking pools by filling those multiplier slots.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

The royalty distribution based on the secondary marketplace:
