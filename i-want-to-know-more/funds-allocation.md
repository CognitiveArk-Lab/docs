# üèõ Funds Allocation

## Initial Sale ‚ú®

Distributions from minting sales are as follow:

* 70% to Project Wallet.
* 30% to Team.

## Project Wallet üöÄ

Project Wallet will be maintained together by the Colony and Team. It is vital for our future project development like Gamification V2, Merch Store, Marketing, and overall welfare of the Colony. In a Nutshell, the Project Wallet is our thrust engine that keeps our Spaceship (Messiah) exploring the fastness space of Terraverse.

## Treasury üíµ

The funds in the Treasury will be later managed by the community decision (DAO). At first, we will allocate the funds to the Colony Investment Program.

### Colony Investment Program (CIP) üìà

With the Colony behind the Treasury, we will discover the best yet safest investment on Terra Ecosystem. So use your DeFi knowledge to make a proposal and vote for the best strategy suggestion to expand our Colony economy!

The first CIP allocation is as follows:

* 70% into [Anchor](https://app.anchorprotocol.com/earn) to receive \~19,47 APY in $UST.
* 30% into the community chosen projects on Terra.

{% hint style="info" %}
After the initial Colony Investment Program, the Colony will be able to submit a proposal after our initial minting phase is over.

The Team will provide the necessary platform for the Colony to open a discussion and vote.
{% endhint %}

Some standard ideas but not limited to:

* Reinvest in Colony Investment Program
* Raising Memory floor price
* Boost the Staking Pool
* Boost the Gamification rewards

## Project Expensesüíº

It is crucial for the Colony to be able to separate Treasury from Project expenses because we have a long road ahead of us.

We will use the Project Wallet mainly on:&#x20;

* Merch Store!
* Marketing
* Development

### Merch Store üõçÔ∏è

What about having our Merch Store that integrates cryptocurrency as the primary payment system? Get your hands on CognitiveArk Tees, Caps, Art prints, and many more!&#x20;

We will funnel the profits back into the Treasury and Project Wallet and increase our existence in both the digital and real world.

### Marketing üì°

We will use the Marketing funds to expand our exposure to other communities. The focus will be on media content like videos, images, and collaborations.

### Development üß∞

We are here to innovate! To be able to terraform the NFT community is our primary goal. We will explore the possibilities of NFT 2.0 to bring more dynamics into our gamification.

## Royalty&#x20;

The royalties from the secondary NFT marketplace are distributed directly into the Staking Pool, where the Colony can claim the funds on our Dashboard on the website.
