## Treasury

More than half of our initial sales will go to the Treasury. The funds in the Treasury will be later managed by the community decision (DAO). At first, we will allocate the funds to the Colony Investment Program.

After the initial Colony Investment Program, we will keep using the Treasury for the Colony's benefit! The Colony will have an open discussion on how we spend the Treasury. These are some standard ideas but not limited to:

* Reinvest in Colony Investment Program
* Raising CogniviteArk floor price
* Boost the Staking Pool
* Boost the Gamification rewards

The Team will provide the necessary platform for the Colony to open a discussion and vote.

### Colony Investment Program (CIP)

With the Colony behind the Treasury, we will discover the best yet safest investment on Terra Ecosystem. So use your DeFi knowledge to make a proposal and vote for the best suggestion to boost our Colony further!

The first CIP allocation is as follows:

* 70% into Anchor to receive \~19,47 APY in $UST.
* 30% into the community chosen project on Terra.

{% hint style="warning" %}
The CIP is the backbone of our project sustainability.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

The profit of CIP will be distributed each month:

* 40% back to the Treasury
* 30% to Gamification rewards
* 10% to Project Wallet
* 20% to Team

## Project Wallet

It is crucial for the Colony to be able to separate Treasury from Project wallet because we have a long road ahead of us.

We will use the Project Wallet mainly on:&#x20;

* Marketing
* Development
* Merch Store!

### Marketing

We will use the Marketing funds to expand our exposure to other communities. The focus will be on media content like videos, images, and other assets.

### Development

We are here to stay and innovate! To be able to terraform the NFT community is our primary goal. We will explore the possibilities of NFT 2.0 to bring more dynamics into our gamification.

### Merch Store

What about having our Merch Store that integrates cryptocurrency as the primary payment system? Get your hands on CognitiveArk Tees, Caps, Art prints, and many more!&#x20;

We will funnel the profits back into the Treasury and Project Wallet and increase our existence in both the digital and real world.

## Royalty

The royalties coming from the secondary NFT marketplace are distributed directly into the Staking Pool, where the Colony can claim the funds on our Dashboard on the website.
