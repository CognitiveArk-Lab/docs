# üèõ Funds Allocation

## <mark style="color:yellow;">Gen0 Initial Sale ‚ú®</mark>

**Distributions from minting sales are as follow:**

* **70% to Project Wallet**
  * _20% to Operational Funds_
  * _80% to Treasury_
* **2.5% to Reward Pool**
* **2.5% to Charity - Angel Protocol**
* **25% to Team**

{% hint style="info" %}
_**100%** of A.N.I.M.A sales proceeds will be directly going to Operational Funds secured with multisig. The royalties will be the same as gen0._
{% endhint %}

## <mark style="color:yellow;">Project Wallet üöÄ</mark>

Project Wallet will be maintained together by Ark-DAO and Team. It is vital for our future project development like Gamification V2, Merch Store, Marketing, and overall welfare of the Colony.&#x20;

{% hint style="success" %}
_In a Nutshell, the Project Wallet is our thrust engine that keeps our Mega Spaceship (Messiah) exploring the fastness space of Terra-verse._
{% endhint %}

![70% of the minting proceeds will fund Project Wallet](<../.gitbook/assets/Finance - Project Wallet (1).jpg>)

## <mark style="color:yellow;">Treasury üíµ</mark>

The first allocation from minting proceeds that arrived in the Treasury will fund the Colony Investment Program (CIP), which Ark-DAO will afterward oversee.

Ark-DAO will have the capacity to decide how the Colony will spend the Treasury. Some _ideas_ but not limited to:

* _Reinvest in Colony Investment Program_
* _Raising Memory floor price_
* _Boost the Reward Pool_
* _Boost the Colony Lottery Pool_

## <mark style="color:yellow;">Colony Investment Program (CIP) üìà</mark>

CIP is a yield farming strategy leveraging Terra DeFi ecosystem. With the Colony behind the Treasury, we will discover the best yet safest investment on Terra Ecosystem. Use your DeFi knowledge to propose or vote for the best yield farming strategy to expand our Colony economy!

**The first CIP allocation is as follows:**

* **70% into** [**Anchor**](https://app.anchorprotocol.com/earn) **to receive \~19,47 APY in $UST (Locked for 2 Years).**
* **30% into the community chosen projects on Terra.**

{% hint style="info" %}
_30% from Treasury will be invested in Terra Ecosystem projects that are chosen by the Ark-DAO. The Colony will be able to submit a proposal after our initial minting phase is over._
{% endhint %}

Each month CIP yield will be distributed to:

* _50% back to the Treasury_
* _20% Reward Pool_
* _10% Colony Lottery_
* _20% Team_

## <mark style="color:yellow;">Operational Fundsüíº</mark>

![](<../.gitbook/assets/Finance - Operational Funds.jpg>)

Due to our commitment to sustainability, we keep operational funds separated from Colony Treasury. We will use the Operational Funds mainly on:&#x20;

* Development
* Marketing
* Merch Store!

### Development üß∞

We are here to innovate! To be able to terraform the NFT community is our primary goal. We will explore the possibilities of NFT 2.0 to bring more dynamics into our gamification.

### Marketing üì°

We will use the Marketing funds to expand our exposure to other communities. The focus will be on media content like videos, images, and collaborations.

### Merch Store üõçÔ∏è

What about having our Merch Store that integrates cryptocurrency as the primary payment system? Get your hands on CognitiveArk Tees, Caps, Art prints, and many more!&#x20;

We will funnel the profits back into the Treasury and Project Wallet and increase our existence in both the digital and real world.

## <mark style="color:yellow;">Reward Pool</mark>

### Reward Pool source of funds:

* 25% from secondary sales [Royalties](funds-allocation.md#royalty)
* 20% from [Colony Investment Program (CIP)](funds-allocation.md#colony-investment-program-cip)

{% hint style="info" %}
_By allocating 2.5% of minting proceeds to the Reward Pool, we ensure a reward payment for each Timeline even before royalties and CIP arrive in the Reward Pool Wallet._
{% endhint %}

![The reward is subject to change depending on source funds](<../.gitbook/assets/Finance - Reward Pool.jpg>)

## <mark style="color:yellow;">Lottery Pool</mark>

### Colony Lottery source of funds:

* 25% from secondary sales [Royalties](funds-allocation.md#royalty)
* 10% from [Colony Investment Program (CIP)](funds-allocation.md#colony-investment-program-cip)

## <mark style="color:yellow;">Royalty</mark> üßæ

The royalties from the secondary NFT marketplace are distributed directly into the [Reward Pool](../lets-terraform-the-nft-culture/reward-system.md#3.-staking-reward), where the Colony can claim the rewards on our Dashboard on the website.

The royalty distribution based on the secondary marketplace:
