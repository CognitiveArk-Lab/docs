# üèõ Funds Allocation

## <mark style="color:yellow;">Gen0 Initial Sale ‚ú®</mark>

**Distributions from minting sales are as follow:**

* **70% to Project Wallet**
  * _20% to Operational Funds_
  * _80% to Treasury_
* **2.5% to** [**Reward Pool**](../injecting-new-nft-culture/reward-system.md#1.-reward-pool)****
* **2.5% to** [**Initial $ARK Liquidity Pool**](../injecting-new-nft-culture/usdark-tokenomics/#1.-initial-liquidity-pool-10-700-000-usdark)****
* **25% to Team**

{% hint style="info" %}
_**100%** of A.N.I.M.A sales proceeds will be directly going to Operational Funds secured with multisig. The royalties distribution will be the_ [_same_](funds-allocation.md#royalty) _as gen0._
{% endhint %}

## <mark style="color:yellow;">Project Wallet üöÄ</mark>

Project Wallet will be maintained together by ArkDAO and TCA Team. It is vital for our future project development like TCA minigames, Merch Store, Marketing, and overall welfare of the Colony.&#x20;

{% hint style="success" %}
_In a Nutshell, the Project Wallet is our thrust engine that keeps our Mega Spaceship (Messiah) exploring the fastness space of the universe._
{% endhint %}

## <mark style="color:yellow;">Treasury üíµ</mark>

The first allocation from minting proceeds that arrived in the Treasury will fund the colony [Multichain Investment Program (MIP)](funds-allocation.md#multichain-investment-program-mip), which ArkDAO will afterward oversee.

ArkDAO will have the capacity to decide how the Colony will spend the Treasury. Some _ideas_ but not limited to:

* _Reinvest in colony Multichain Investment Program_
* _Buyback program (Raising Memory floor price)_
* _Boost the Reward Pool_
* _Investing in new emerging projects_
* _Donate to a charity_

## <mark style="color:yellow;">Multichain Investment Program (MIP) üìà</mark>

MIP is a yield farming strategy leveraging the borderless DeFi ecosystem. We emphasize the importance of having a Treasury backed by diverse assets from different ecosystems, ensuring the flexibility to catch opportunities on many chains, and having extra security when it comes to unwanted events like a specific chain exploits or avoiding a Bank run.

With the Colony behind the Treasury, we will discover the best yet safest investment on each chain. Use your DeFi knowledge to propose or vote for the best yield farming strategy to expand our Colony economy!

{% hint style="danger" %}
_<mark style="color:red;">The allocation for MIP on this page is</mark> <mark style="color:red;"></mark><mark style="color:red;">**not yet finalized and acts as an EXAMPLE**</mark><mark style="color:red;">, as we will have to always adapt to the current market narrative.</mark>_&#x20;
{% endhint %}

**The first MIP allocation is as follows:**

* **40% into Solana ecosystem**
  * 20% into [SOL lending](https://francium.io/app/lend) pools on Francium.&#x20;
  * 20% into [SOL-USDC LP](https://francium.io/app/invest/farm) farm on Francium.
* **60% into other ecosystems**&#x20;
  * Binance - 20% into [BUSD-BNB LP](https://pancakeswap.finance/info/pool/0x58F876857a02D6762E0101bb5C46A8c1ED44Dc16) farm on PancakeSwap.
  * Avalanche - 15% into [AVAX-ETH LP](https://yieldyak.com/farms/detail/0x5219558ee591b030E075892acc41334A1694fd8A) farm on YieldYak.
  * Fantom - 10% into [USDC-FTM LP](https://info.spooky.fi/) farm on SpookySwap.
  * Arbitrum - 15% into[ USDT-BTC-ETH](https://app.beefy.finance/#/arbitrum/vault/curve-arb-tricrypto) farm on Curve.

{% hint style="info" %}
_Funds from Treasury will be invested in emerging projects that are chosen by the ArkDAO. The Colony will be able to submit a proposal after our initial minting phase is over._
{% endhint %}

Each month MIP yield will be distributed as follows:

* _40% Back to Treasury_
* _40% Ark Vault_
* _20% Team_

## <mark style="color:yellow;">Operational Fundsüíº</mark>

![](<../.gitbook/assets/Finance - Operational Funds.jpg>)

Due to our commitment to sustainability, we keep operational funds separated from Colony Treasury. We will use the Operational Funds mainly on:&#x20;

* Development
* Marketing
* Merch Store!

### Development üß∞

We are here to innovate! Being able to contribute to the NFT community is our primary goal. We will explore the possibilities of NFT 2.0 to bring more dynamics into our gamification while also developing more use cases like TCA Minigames, thus bringing more value to the project.

### Marketing üì°

We will use the Marketing funds to expand our exposure to other communities. The focus will be on media content like videos, images, and collaborations.

### Merch Store üõçÔ∏è

What about having our Merch Store that integrates cryptocurrency as the primary payment system? Get your hands on CognitiveArk Tees, Caps, Art prints, and many more!&#x20;

The payment will be on-chain and the profits will go back into the Treasury and Project Wallet and increase our presence in both the digital and real world.

## <mark style="color:yellow;">Reward Pool</mark>

### Reward Pool source of funds:

* 30% from secondary sales [Royalties](funds-allocation.md#royalty)
* 20% from [Colony Investment Program (MIP)](funds-allocation.md#colony-investment-program-cip)

{% hint style="info" %}
_By allocating 2.5% of minting proceeds to the Reward Pool, we ensure a reward payment for each Timeline even before royalties and MIP arrive in the Reward Pool Wallet._
{% endhint %}

![The reward is subject to change depending on source funds](<../.gitbook/assets/Finance - Reward Pool.jpg>)

## <mark style="color:yellow;">Royalty</mark> üßæ

80% of the royalties from the secondary NFT marketplace are distributed back to the community. It will be split directly into the [Project Wallet](funds-allocation.md#project-wallet), [Reward Pool](../injecting-new-nft-culture/reward-system.md#3.-staking-reward), and [Ark Vault](../injecting-new-nft-culture/usdark-tokenomics/#tca-vaults). Where the Colony can claim them as rewards on our Dashboard on the website.

The royalty distribution is based on the secondary marketplace:
