# ‚òÑ Welcome to The Cognitive Ark

## <mark style="color:yellow;">What is The Cognitive Ark?</mark>

_**CognitiveArk**_ is an interactive comic NFT attempting to change the NFT art landscape with its straightforward gamification. We are aiming to contribute to the NFT Culture with our unique Art style, also developing NFT 2.0 for the next generation. Opening up numerous unexplored possibilities that are once holding us (creators) back. In addition, this doc will provide more details about [_lore_](injecting-new-nft-culture/story-and-lore.md)_,_ [_gamification mechanics_](injecting-new-nft-culture/gamification/), the [_reward system_](injecting-new-nft-culture/reward-system.md)_,_ [_tokenomics_](injecting-new-nft-culture/tokenomics.md)_,_ and [_funds allocation_](i-want-to-know-more/funds-allocation.md) for transparency of **CognitiveArk** NFTs.

{% hint style="info" %}
We encourage you to begin from the [lore](injecting-new-nft-culture/story-and-lore.md) to get the hype and feel about CognitiveArk as a project and continue reading until you reach the [reward system](injecting-new-nft-culture/reward-system.md). But anyway, you can always come back here to dig in more üòÅ
