# ‚òÑ Welcome to CognitiveArk

## What is CognitiveArk?

_**CognitiveArk**_ is a multidimensional story-based NFT attempting to change the NFT art landscape with its straightforward gamification. Not just that, we are also aiming to terraform the NFT Culture with our unique Art style, opening up numerous unexplored possibilities that are once holding us (creators) back. In addition, this doc will provide more details about _lore, tokenomics, gamification mechanics_, and the _reward system_ of **CognitiveArk** NFTs.

{% hint style="info" %}
We encourage you to begin from the [lore](lets-terraform-the-nft-culture/story-and-lore.md) to get the hype and feel about CognitiveArk as a project and continue reading until you reach the [reward system](lets-terraform-the-nft-culture/reward-system.md). But anyway, you can always come back here to dig in more üòÅ

## Why Terra üåî blockchain?

We are a big believer in innovation, and we consider that what [terra.money](https://www.terra.money) as a blockchain is accomplishing right now will change the future of DeFi and the future of banking. The ecosystem is a birthplace for algorithmic decentralized stablecoin _$UST_, it also houses many high-quality protocols, and CognitiveArk is proud to be a part of the ecosystem. The number of unique addresses/wallets is growing steadily every month. The strong developer community combined with the ever-growing adoption and the support from #LUNAtics are one of the reasons we deploy our contracts on Terra.
